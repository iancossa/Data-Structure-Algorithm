# Data-Structure-Algorithm
ðŸ“š Data-Structure-Algorithm
I'm currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and this repository is where I'll share my journey.

ðŸ”¹ What to expect:

My notes, code snippets, and practice problems as I learn DSA step by step

Implementations of basic data structures like arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs (as I study them)

Classic algorithms including sorting, searching, and traversal techniques

LeetCode/GeeksforGeeks solutions and personal explanations

This repo is a learning-in-progress and will grow as I explore more topics. Feel free to follow along or suggest resources and challenges!
